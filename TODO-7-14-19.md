# Helpful tips for Sunday's meeting

Sorry I can't make it, hopefully this document will help some. I don't know how much you know about how the Pi, Linux in general, or Python works, but I'll do my best.

## Basic info about the Pi

To turn on the Pi, have the monitor, keyboard and mouse plugged in before plugging in the power cord.

You won't be asked for a password when the Pi is booting. You may need the password later, so here is the login info.

Username: pi

Password: sandwich

Application shortcuts are on the top left of the screen with more if you click on the raspberry, and settings widgets are on the top right.

You will be using the terminal emulator, which is the icon that looks like `>_`.

## WiFi

I don't know if you'll need WiFi, but here's how to get it.

1. If the Pi is not already on the network, click on the little wifi icon in the top right of the screen and click on attwifi.
2. Open up the Internet browser (globe icon). Go to 1.1.1.1 (IP address, works like a URL for our purposes).
3. Follow the instructions on that webpage.

If you get a complaint about time or date not being correct:

1. Go to raspi-config: Click on the raspberry, then go to Preferences, then go to Raspberry Pi Configuration
2. Go to Localisation
3. Go to Set Timezone...
4. Choose any of the following until you find something that works.
   1. Area = America/Indiana, Location = Indianapolis
   2. Location = GMT
   3. Area = Etc, Location = GMT-4
   
If nothing works, don't worry about it. If all goes well you *shouldn't* need WiFi on the Pi.
